Task 8: Fix security CLI continuity path (single execution, correct wiring)

ISSUE ANALYSIS:
===============

The CLI had a duplicate/unnecessary registration pattern:

1. SECURITY_REVIEWER_AGENT was being registered in AgentRegistry (lines 410-420, 435)
2. But this agent was NEVER used because:
   - SecurityReviewer.prefers_direct_review() returns True (from agents/security.py:45)
   - PRReviewOrchestrator checks "if self.use_agent_runtime and not prefers_direct_review()" (orchestrator.py:195)
   - When prefers_direct_review() is True, the agent takes the direct path: agent.review(context)
   - AgentRuntime path is bypassed entirely for security agent

3. The SECURITY_REVIEWER_AGENT registration was effectively dead code - always created, never used

SECURITY PATH EXECUTION FLOW:
============================

When user runs: iron-rook review --agent security

BEFORE FIX:
1. CLI creates SECURITY_REVIEWER_AGENT (Agent instance)
2. CLI registers it in agent_registry
3. CLI creates PRReviewOrchestrator with use_agent_runtime=True
4. Orchestrator gets SecurityReviewer from registry
5. SecurityReviewer.prefers_direct_review() returns True
6. Orchestrator calls SecurityReviewer.review(context) directly
7. AgentRuntime is NEVER used for security
8. SECURITY_REVIEWER_AGENT registration is WASTED

AFTER FIX:
1. CLI does NOT create SECURITY_REVIEWER_AGENT (removed dead code)
2. CLI does NOT register it (removed unnecessary registration)
3. CLI creates PRReviewOrchestrator with use_agent_runtime=True
4. Orchestrator gets SecurityReviewer from registry
5. SecurityReviewer.prefers_direct_review() returns True
6. Orchestrator calls SecurityReviewer.review(context) directly
7. No duplicate/unnecessary code

FUTURE WORK:
=============
To properly integrate FSM security orchestrator with CLI and use AgentRuntime:
- Create SecurityFSMReviewer class that extends BaseReviewerAgent
- Wrap SecurityReviewOrchestrator within that class
- Implement prefers_direct_review() to return False (to use AgentRuntime)
- Register SecurityFSMReviewer in registry instead of deprecated SecurityReviewer
