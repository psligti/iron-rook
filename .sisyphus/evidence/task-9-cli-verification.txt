CLI Verification Evidence
=======================

ContextBuilder Removal from Orchestrator:
---------------------------------------

Before (had context_builder):
  - Line 26: from iron_rook.review.context_builder import ContextBuilder, DefaultContextBuilder
  - Line 51: discovery: EntryPointDiscovery | None = None,
  - Line 52: context_builder: ContextBuilder | None = None,
  - Line 60: self.discovery = discovery or EntryPointDiscovery()
  - Line 62: self.context_builder = context_builder or DefaultContextBuilder(self.discovery)

After (all removed):
  - No context_builder imports
  - No discovery imports
  - __init__ only has: subagents, command_executor, stream_manager, merge_policy
  - No self.discovery or self.context_builder attributes

Note:
  - The CLI does not yet build ReviewContext directly because:
    1. The orchestrator's run_subagents_parallel method was removed in Wave 2
    2. The orchestrator is currently incomplete/broken
    3. Task 13 (Simplify PRReviewOrchestrator) will fix the full execution flow
    4. When that's done, ReviewContext will need to be built (either in CLI or orchestrator)

Status:
  - ContextBuilder file: DELETED ✓
  - Orchestrator imports: CLEANED ✓
  - Orchestrator __init__ parameters: CLEANED ✓
