2. import asyncio
3. import logging
4. from typing import List, Callable
5. from iron_rook.review.base import BaseReviewerAgent, ReviewContext
6. from iron_rook.review.contracts import (Finding, MergeGate, MergePolicy, OrchestratorOutput, PriorityMergePolicy, ReviewInputs, ReviewOutput, Scope, ToolPlan)

=== Class Structure ===
PRReviewOrchestrator (309 lines)

Methods:
1. __init__(self, subagents, command_executor=None, merge_policy=None)
   - 3 parameters (all used)
   - No dead code

2. run_review(self, inputs, stream_callback=None)
   - Main orchestration method
   - Calls run_subagents_parallel in single path

3. run_subagents_parallel(self, inputs, stream_callback=None)
   - Inline ReviewContext building (no ContextBuilder)
   - Semaphore limiting (max 4 concurrent)
   - Direct agent.review() calls (single execution path)
   - Timeout and error handling

4. compute_merge_decision(self, results)
   - Uses merge_policy.compute_merge_decision()

5. dedupe_findings(self, all_findings)
   - Simple title+severity deduplication

6. generate_tool_plan(self, results)
   - Collects commands from all check results

7. execute_command(self, command, timeout=30)
   - CommandExecutor interface

=== Execution Path ===
- Single execution path: YES (direct agent.review() calls)
- AgentRuntime usage: NO (removed in Task 8)
- FSM orchestration: NO (removed in Task 10)
- Dual paths: NO (removed in Task 8)

=== Removed Features (verified absent) ===
- ReviewStreamManager: removed (Task 4)
- BudgetConfig/BudgetTracker: removed (Task 6)
- Delegation system: removed (Task 7)
- Dual execution paths: removed (Task 8)
- ContextBuilder: removed (Task 9)
- FSM security orchestrator: removed (Task 10)
- FSM contracts: removed (Task 11)
- FSMSecurityOrchestrator: removed (Task 12)

=== Code Quality ===
- No dead imports
- No unused code
- No TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK markers
- No technical debt comments
- Compiles without errors
- Single execution path
- Clean method signatures

=== Conclusion ===
PRReviewOrchestrator is fully simplified:
- 309 lines (55% reduction from original 683 lines)
- Clean imports (all used)
- Single execution path (direct agent calls)
- No FSM orchestration (removed)
- No dual paths (removed)
- No dead code (all verified)
